## -Steps (Topic Modelling) (Programming language: Python):
  ### 1. Transform the data for analysis (i.e., flatten the json file based on the number of comments per video)
      #### Note: If your dataset already has an equal amount of rows for each comment per video, then you can skip this step
  ### 2. Clean the data (i.e., flag bots and non-English comments)
  ### 3. Fit a LDA model to the cleaned data

## -Steps (Sentiment Analysis) (programming language: R):
  ### 1. Further clean the comments
  ### 2. Create a sentiment analysis custom-dictionary
  ### 3. Compute the polarity score for each of the comments
