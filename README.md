## Steps:
  ### 1. Transform the data for analysis (i.e., flatten the json file based on the number of comments per video)
      #### Note: If you dataset already has an equal amount of rows for each comment per video, than you can skip this step
  ### 2. Clean the data (i.e., flag bots and non-English comments)
